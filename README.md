# Welcome To Subterranean
This is a survival mining game, -to be continued-

## What am I working on right now
Right now Im working on rewriteing the whole engine back up to Pre-Alpha-v0.8 once im done rewriting the engine to the previouse state I will change the stage of develpment to Alpha-v0.1 once the engine is rewriten back to how it was before.
Since rewriting the engine I have been able to get 4 times as much prefromance then the last engine by being smart and using a chunk system, by the way if your making a game similir to this one I highly recomend using some time of chunk system it really helps prefromance a lot.
