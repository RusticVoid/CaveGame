# Welcome To Subterranean
This is a survival mining game, -to be continued-

## What am I working on right now
Right now I'm working on rewriting the whole engine back up to Pre-Alpha-v0.8. Once I'm done rewriting the engine to its previous state I will change the stage of development to Alpha-v0.1. Since rewriting the engine I have been able to get 4 times as much performance then the last engine by being smart and using a chunk system, by the way if you're making a game similar to this one I highly recommend using some type of chunk system it really helps performance a lot.

## How to run game:
### Windows
1. Unzip the file to where ever you want the game to be
2. Insize the unzipped file there should be a "runGame.bat"
3. Double click "runGame.bat" to start the game
4. IF YOU GAME DOES NOT SHOW A CONSOLE THEN RUN "runGameW11.bat"
### Linux
1. Unzip the file to where ever you want the game to be
2. Insize the unzipped file there should be a "runGame.sh"
3. Open folder where "runGame.sh" is in your terminal
4. Run "./runGame.sh" to start the game
### WARNING THIS IS NOT RECOMENDED IF YOU ARE RUNNING LOW END HARDWARE
### How to change window resolution
If you want to change the window resolution go into "/src/conf.lua" and change "t.window.width = 800" and "t.window.height = 600" to the window size you want.
